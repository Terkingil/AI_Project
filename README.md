# Time Series analysis in stock market using Statistical and Machine Learning approaches

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock market trends using advanced Machine Learning techniques. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the project explores different approaches, including a basic LSTM model and an embedding-enhanced LSTM model, for effective time series analysis of stock prices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Google Colab**: All code has been developed and tested in Google Colab. Ensure you have access to Google Colab to run the notebooks.
- **Python**: The code is written in Python, and Google Colab should have all necessary Python libraries pre-installed.

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine or Google Drive.
2. Open the `AI_project.ipynb` file in Google Colab for executing the code.

### Required Data
- `stock_prices.csv`: This file contains the stock price data necessary for running the code. Ensure this file is in the same directory as the `AI_project.ipynb` notebook.

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Open `AI_project.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially. The notebook is designed to guide you through the process, from data loading to model training and predictions.

## Models and Weights
- The models are defined within the `AI_project.ipynb` notebook.
- Pre-trained weights for each model are stored in the `weights` folder. These weights can be loaded to quickly utilize the models without retraining.
